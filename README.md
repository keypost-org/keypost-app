# Keypost App

#### This serves as the main user facing application for authenticated users. Security is the number one priority!

### Configuration
 - To override the default port, export `ROCKET_PORT`
 - Verbose mode for development, set `ROCKET_LOG` to `debug`
 - You can also consider adding a [`Rocket.toml` file](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/blob/36c1570c614e3b9c1ff6a33f0ebd3c94b440e2cc/site/guide/9-configuration.md#rockettoml).
